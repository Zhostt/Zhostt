### Hi there, I am Boris, and this is my humble GitHub profile.

I worked hard for quite a time, and now I am proud to introduce my skills of Frontend-Developer.

JS, DOM, Git, Linux console, Jest testing, React, Vue - You name it.

All what is left is to put it to good use. 
Will you provide such?
